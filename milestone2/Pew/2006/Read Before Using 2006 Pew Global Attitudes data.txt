PEW RESEARCH CENTER - Global Attitudes Project
Spring 2006 15 Nation Survey


It is important to read this information before using the 2006 Pew Global Attitudes Survey dataset because there was some 
oversampling done of European Muslim populations for which a special weight and filter need to be used to get accurate results.

1.	This survey includes data for general populations and European Muslim populations. 
 
2.	There are specific weights that must be used for the general populations and the European Muslim populations.  A filter must also be used 
	when seeking to use the European Muslim oversamples.

	a.	The weight that must be used when looking to analyze the attitudes and opinions of general populations* is:
		
		General population variable name:  Weight
			

	*General population data from Great Britain, France, Germany, and Spain include Muslim oversamples, but is weighted to be representative of the 
	general population. 

	b.	The filter and weight that must be used when seeking to analyze the attitudes and opinions of European Muslims are:

		European Muslim Filter variable name:  Muslim
		European Muslim Weight variable name:  Allmuslimswt


3.	The full topline results for the general populations as well as the European Muslim populations are included in the topline provided with the 2006 dataset.

4.	The topline also provides full question wording for all questions included in the survey.

5.	The data in the SPSS dataset for the 2006 Pew Global Attitudes Survey is NOT in the same order as the data in the topline for the 2006 survey.  
	However, the question numbers correspond in both the topline and the SPSS dataset.

***NOTE:
The Nigerian sample includes 514 Christians and 468 Muslims.  The general population sample is weighted to reflect the demographic characteristics 
of the population.  Views of Christian and Muslim Nigerians as well as Nigerians overall are reported in the 2006 Topline and can be found by using 
the ReligionNig variable when analyzing the data.
