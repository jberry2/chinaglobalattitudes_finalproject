Does attitudes towards China vary with amount of trade? So do countries that
trade more with China lead to more negative/positive attitudes towards China?

output: favoribility towards China by country

Clean up datasets, merge by country, trade as percentage of GDP


```{r}
cc_2019 <- read_sav("2019 Chicago Council Survey - Datafile.sav")

pew_2019 <- 
read_sav("Pew Research Center Global Attitudes Spring 2019 Dataset WEB.sav") %>%
  as_factor()

glimpse(pew_2019)

pew_2019_c <- pew_2019 %>%
  filter(country == "United States") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = FAV_CHINA)) +
  geom_bar()
  

```
